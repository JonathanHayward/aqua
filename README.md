## I Miss Aqua: A Retro-themed Maverick

*I've been trying to find a way to get Aqua back on my Mac*,
and getting Aqua
to display under any OS has been a trackless waste. But I've been able to
stitch something together (nothing new) to offer a Linux old enough to display
old Aqua themes and "look and feel" appropriately, while running a modern
version of Firefox. And now it's here.

Some people regard the Aqua theme as done and gone, and pass&eacute;. It's
out of the Mac mainstream at any rate, and has been for the past couple of
releases of Mac OSX.

But with a little help from VMware and a little open
sourced Linux theming magic, it's possible to get Aqua back.
